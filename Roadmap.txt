[LightType roadmap/plan]
Hey all! This is just a small plan of what I want LightType to be on release.

[Team]
LightType's development team will consist of 2 people with write access to the repo, however, LightType will also be open-source!
Feel free to join in on the development!

[Language]
LightType will be in python. We are currently looking at distribution options as we know that python is somewhat inconvienient
in terms of distribution.

[LightType as a whole]
LightType will be a fully mouse free typing test, that has a keyboard friendly settings page, and for convenience, 
a fully working commandline. We plan to rely on the arrow keys to quickly switch between menus.

[Future plans/features]
We are looking at the possiblility of adding steno support, as we have noticed that typing programs for steno aimed at beginners are lacking in features or
are non-existent. Other than that, we don't really know. If you have a suggestion, create a disscussion here on the projects github!

[The exciting stuff (The actual roadmap)]
v0.0.1 - A base version of LightType that is suited for release. Will be missing features that we feel is important that will
later be added down the road(map).
v0.0.11 - I only added this as a note, but we will use updates as such to fix bugs or make and test small improvements and features.
v0.0.3 - A more fleshed out version of LightType. Will include features such as navigation and test settings. We feel that this version will be the most suitable
candiate for a beta release of LightType!
